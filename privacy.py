<p>Every page loads Google Analytics 4 (Google tag <code>gtag.js</code>, measurement ID <code>{e(ga_id)}</code>) from <code>www.googletagmanager.com</code>. We use it only to count visits and see which pages are useful. It's provided by Google LLC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it collects:</strong> the pages you view, the standard events Google Analytics records automatically (for example page views and scrolls), clicks on links that leave the site (recorded with the destination's domain and the full destination URL, never with anything you type), the page that referred you, your browser and device type, screen size, language, and an approximate location (country, region or city) that Google derives from your IP address. Google states that Google Analytics 4 does not log or store IP addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Google Analytics sets first-party cookies named <code>_ga</code> and <code>_ga_&lt;ID&gt;</code> on {e(domain)} to tell one visit from another. Google documents a lifetime of up to 2 years for these cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Our settings:</strong> Google signals is turned off, event-level data is kept for 2 months (the shortest option Google Analytics offers), and the property isn't linked to Google Ads. The account's data-sharing settings are on, which lets Google use the data as described in <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1011397" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics data-sharing settings</a>.</li>
<li><strong>What we see:</strong> aggregate reports (page views, traffic sources, countries, device types). We don't see your name, email address or IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Opting out:</strong> you can block or delete cookies in your browser, use a content blocker, or install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>. Google explains its practices in <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services</a>.</li>

<p>Every page also loads Microsoft Clarity (project ID <code>{e(clarity_id)}</code>) from <code>www.clarity.ms</code>. It's provided by Microsoft. We use it to see how visitors use the site, for example which parts of a page people click or scroll to, and which traffic channels (including links from AI chat tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude and Perplexity) send visitors here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it collects:</strong> Microsoft says Clarity "captures the user interactions on your website such as, how the page is rendering, user interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, scrolls". Clarity uses this to build session recordings and heatmaps. Text typed into input boxes is masked. Microsoft says recordings are kept for 30 days (a sample for up to 9 months) and heatmaps for up to 9 months.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Clarity sets first-party cookies named <code>_clck</code> (keeps a Clarity user ID for this site) and <code>_clsk</code> (links page views into one session). Microsoft also lists third-party cookies (<code>CLID</code>, <code>ANONCHK</code>, <code>MR</code>, <code>MUID</code>, <code>SM</code>) that Clarity may set; Microsoft says <code>MUID</code> is used "for advertising, site analytics, and other operational purposes". If you've disabled cookies in your browser, Clarity doesn't set them. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/setup-and-installation/cookie-list" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft's Clarity cookie list</a>.</li>
<li><strong>What we see:</strong> Clarity dashboards, heatmaps and session recordings. We don't use Clarity to collect your name or email address.</li>
<li><strong>Opting out:</strong> Microsoft says you can opt out of Clarity through the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out system (choose Microsoft), and that Clarity supports Global Privacy Control (GPC). Microsoft also says Clarity doesn't currently respond to browser Do-Not-Track signals. You can also block or delete cookies in your browser or use a content blocker. Details are in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Clarity FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a>.</li>

<p>{e(site)} (<code>{e(domain)}</code>) is published by {OPERATOR}. This page explains what information is collected when you visit, by whom, and why. Questions or requests: <a href="mailto:{CONTACT}">{CONTACT}</a>.</p>
<h2>The short version</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are no accounts, sign-ups, comment boxes, newsletters, contact forms or payments on {e(site)}. We don't ask for your name, email address or any other personal details.</li>
<li>We use Google Analytics to count visits{' and Microsoft Clarity to see how pages are used (clicks and scrolling)' if clarity_id else ''}. They use cookies.</li>
<li>Videos are click-to-play. Nothing from the YouTube player loads until you press play.</li>
<li>Our host, GitHub Pages, logs visitors' IP addresses for its own security purposes.</li>
<li>We don't sell personal information, and we don't show ads from ad networks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Embedded YouTube videos</h2>
<p>Some pages include a short video from our YouTube channel (pages with a video: {vids}). The video uses a click-to-play preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you press play, the page shows only a still preview image loaded from YouTube's image server (<code>i.ytimg.com</code>). As with any image from another site, your browser's request tells that server your IP address and browser details. No YouTube player or YouTube script loads at this point.</li>
<li>When you press play, the player loads from <code>www.youtube-nocookie.com</code>, YouTube's privacy-enhanced mode. From then on, YouTube (Google) receives information about your viewing and may store cookies or similar data on your device, as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
<li>"Watch on YouTube" and channel links take you to youtube.com, where YouTube's own policies apply.</li>

<h2>Hosting and server logs</h2>
<p>{e(site)} is a static website hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, a service of GitHub, Inc. GitHub states that when a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and stored for security purposes, whether or not the visitor is signed in to GitHub (see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#data-collection" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub Pages data collection</a> and the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub General Privacy Statement</a>). We don't receive or have access to those logs.</p>
<h2>Things that stay in your browser</h2>
<p>{e(filter_note)} It runs entirely in your browser: what you type or select isn't sent to us or stored. (Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity may record that you interacted with the page, as described above, but not the text you type.)</p>
<h2>If you email us</h2>
<p>If you email us (for example to report an out-of-date listing), we receive your email address and whatever you include in the message. We use it only to reply and to fix the listing. We don't add it to a mailing list or share it.</p>
<h2>Links to other websites</h2>
<p>{e(site)} links to many other websites: the organizations and brands we list, their sources, and other services. Those sites have their own privacy practices, which this policy doesn't cover.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>{e(site)} isn't directed at children under 13, and we don't knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
<h2>Your choices and requests</h2>
<p>You can control cookies through your browser settings and the Google Analytics opt-out add-on linked above. If you have a question about this policy, or want to make a request about your information, email <a href="mailto:{CONTACT}">{CONTACT}</a>. Keep in mind that we don't hold analytics data tied to your name or email, and we can't access GitHub's server logs, so for data held by Google, Microsoft or GitHub you may need to contact them directly.</p>
<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>If the site starts collecting something new (for example a new analytics tool, embed or affiliate program), we'll update this page and the effective date above before or when the change goes live.</p>"""
